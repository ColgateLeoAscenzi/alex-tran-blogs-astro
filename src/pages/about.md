## About Me

Hi, my name is Quang-Anh Ngo Tran (Alex Tran), and I am the author of this blog! It is important to note that this blog is a collective work. I owe a lot to the feedback of Dr. Amanda Diekman, Dr. Shahana Ansari, Andrew White, and Sarah Hunter.

I am a second-year graduate student in Social Psychology at Indiana University Bloomington from Vietnam, advised by Dr. Amanda Diekman. I am particularly interested in stereotyping, bias, prejudice, intersectionality, and interminority coalition.

I love reading, dancing, creative writing, and playing League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics in my free time.
